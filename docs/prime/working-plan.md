# Development Plan: FlashDraft MTG Draft Simulator

## Overview
Building an integrated Magic: The Gathering draft simulation and playtesting platform that enables unlimited practice with AI opponents trained on real 17lands data. The core workflow is: Draft â†’ (Edit Deck â†’ Playtest) Loop â†’ New Draft

The goal is for someone without any set knowledge to learn to draft by playtesting their deck immediately against real decks.

## Approach
- **MVP-first**: Start with functional draft + basic playtest, then enhance AI
- **Data-driven bots**: Use 17lands datasets for realistic opponent behavior
- **Performance-focused**: <150ms transitions, keyboard shortcuts, snappy interactions
- **Goldfishing-oriented**: Interface is optimized for rapid iteration and goldfishing, to get a good "feel" of the pick process, and a feel for how it affects the deck
  - eg: mana curve distribution
  - creature count
  - card type distribution
- **Low barrier to exploration**: quick back-and-forth between deckbuild and playtest.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Astro + React islands + TypeScript for optimal performance âœ“ (Implemented)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind for rapid, consistent interface development âœ“ (Implemented with HoverCard component)
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity and snappy state updates âœ“ (Implemented complete draft store)
- **Backend**: Astro endpoints https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/ âœ“ (API endpoints for sets working)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for card data, pickle for trained models âœ“ (Scryfall data cached as JSON)
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn for pairwise ranking models (simple, effective) (Pending 17lands integration)

### Current Technical State
- **Components**: Card, CardImage, CardOverlay, CardTypeIndicators, PackDisplay, DraftInterface, DraftApp
- **Store**: Complete Zustand store with draft state, player management, pack passing, pick tracking
- **API**: Working endpoints at /api/sets and /api/sets/[setCode] serving DTK/FIN data
- **Styling**: Full Tailwind + shadcn/ui integration with proper CSS variables
- **Data**: Two complete MTG sets (DTK: 264 cards, FIN: sets) with images cached from Scryfall
- **Pack Generation**: Realistic rarity distributions (1 rare/mythic, 3 uncommons, 11 commons)
- **Pick Priority**: Basic algorithm (rarity + creature + removal bonuses) - needs 17lands data upgrade

### Key Challenges & Solutions
- **Bot Realism**: Use 17lands real pick data, validate against human baselines
- **Ultra-fast Transitions**: <150ms target requires optimized state management, minimal re-renders
- **Goldfishing UX**: Design for rapid iteration - keyboard shortcuts, visual feedback, instant deck stats
- **Learning Feedback Loop**: Visual cues that connect draft picks to deck performance patterns
- **Card Data**: Source from Scryfall API, cache locally, version appropriately
- **Draft State**: Immutable updates, clear action patterns, robust error handling
- **Deck Analysis**: Real-time mana curve and composition feedback without performance impact

### Dependencies & Risks
- **17lands Data Access**: Public datasets available, but format coverage varies
- **Card Image Rights**: Use Scryfall API with proper attribution
- **ML Training Time**: Initial model training should be <30 minutes on laptop
- **User Adoption**: Target existing Limited community through focused features

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Deep Learning vs. Pairwise Ranking**: Chose pairwise for interpretability and data efficiency
- **Real-time vs. Turn-based**: Chose turn-based for simplicity and focus on learning
- **Full Rules Engine vs. Manual**: Chose manual for faster development and flexibility

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete draft simulation in <5 minutes
- [ ] Draft â†” deckbuild â†” goldfish transitions in <150ms
- [ ] Bot pick agreement with humans >70%
- [ ] Goldfishing feels smooth and responsive (no lag)
- [ ] Clear visual feedback on deck composition and balance
- [ ] Learning loop enables rapid skill improvement through iteration
- [ ] Core functionality works reliably for 1-2 MTG formats
- [ ] Essential test coverage for stability
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met consistently

## Data Requirements
- [ ] **Final Fantasy (FIN)** set data from Scryfall API - Universes Beyond set with unique mechanics
- [ ] **Tarkir: Dragonstorm (TDM)** set data from Scryfall API - classic draft format with dragon tribal
- [ ] 17lands draft data for both ACR and DTK formats
- [ ] 17lands card ratings and pick data for realistic bot behavior
- [ ] Successful deck lists from 17lands for both formats
- [ ] Card images and mana symbols from Scryfall (with proper caching)
- [ ] Set booster pack compositions and rarity distributions

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
