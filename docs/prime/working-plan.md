## URGENT: Architecture Refactor - Separate Draft Engine from Frontend

### Current Issues
- **Mixed Concerns**: Draft logic is tightly coupled with React/Zustand/UI code
- **State Management Complexity**: Multiple sources of truth (store, localStorage, URL)
- **Navigation Issues**: Full page refreshes losing state, complex load/save timing
- **Testing Difficulty**: Can't test draft logic independently of UI

# Development Plan: Draft Engine Architecture

## Overview
Design a pure draft engine that handles all MTG draft logic independently from any UI framework. The engine will be the single source of truth for draft state, with the UI acting as a view layer.

## Draft Engine Design

### Core Concepts

```typescript
// The draft engine manages the entire draft state
interface DraftEngine {
  // Immutable state
  readonly state: DraftState;
  
  // Query methods (pure, no side effects)
  getCurrentPack(playerId: string): Pack | null;
  getPlayerCards(playerId: string): Card[];
  getAvailableActions(playerId: string): Action[];
  canMakePick(playerId: string, cardId: string): boolean;
  getDraftStatus(): DraftStatus;
  
  // Action methods (return new engine instance)
  applyAction(action: DraftAction): DraftEngine;
  
  // Serialization
  serialize(): string;
  static deserialize(data: string): DraftEngine;
  static create(config: DraftConfig): DraftEngine;
}

// Core state shape
interface DraftState {
  id: string;
  config: DraftConfig;
  players: Player[];
  packs: Pack[][];  // [round][packIndex]
  currentRound: number;
  currentPick: number;
  direction: 'clockwise' | 'counterclockwise';
  status: 'setup' | 'active' | 'complete';
  history: DraftAction[];  // All actions taken
}

// Actions are the only way to modify state
type DraftAction = 
  | { type: 'ADD_PLAYER'; playerId: string; name: string; isBot: boolean }
  | { type: 'START_DRAFT' }
  | { type: 'MAKE_PICK'; playerId: string; cardId: string }
  | { type: 'TIME_OUT_PICK'; playerId: string }  // Auto-pick for timer
  | { type: 'UNDO_LAST_ACTION' };  // For development/testing
```

### Engine Characteristics

1. **Pure Functions**: All methods are pure - same input always produces same output
2. **Immutable State**: Actions return new engine instances, never mutate
3. **Self-Contained**: All draft rules encoded in the engine
4. **Serializable**: Can save/load complete draft state
5. **Replayable**: Can rebuild any draft state by replaying actions

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
// Actions return Result type for proper error handling
type ActionResult<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: DraftError };

type DraftError = 
  | { type: 'INVALID_PICK'; message: string; cardId: string }
  | { type: 'WRONG_PLAYER'; message: string; playerId: string }
  | { type: 'DRAFT_NOT_ACTIVE'; message: string }
  | { type: 'INVALID_ACTION'; message: string };

class DraftEngine {
  applyAction(action: DraftAction): ActionResult<DraftEngine> {
    // Validate action first
    const validation = this.validateAction(action);
    if (!validation.success) {
      return validation;
    }
    
    // Apply action if valid
    const newEngine = this.executeAction(action);
    return { success: true, data: newEngine };
  }
  
  private validateAction(action: DraftAction): ActionResult<void> {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'MAKE_PICK':
        if (!this.canMakePick(action.playerId, action.cardId)) {
          return { 
            success: false, 
            error: { type: 'INVALID_PICK', message: 'Card not available', cardId: action.cardId }
          };
        }
        break;
      // ... other validations
    }
    return { success: true, data: undefined };
  }
}
```

### Pack Generation & Initialization

```typescript
// Pack generation happens during engine creation
class DraftEngine {
  static create(config: DraftConfig): DraftEngine {
    // Generate all packs upfront for entire draft
    const allPacks = generateDraftPacks(config.setData, config.playerCount);
    
    return new DraftEngine({
      id: generateDraftId(),
      config,
      players: [],
      packs: allPacks, // [round][packIndex] - all 3 rounds pre-generated
      currentRound: 1,
      currentPick: 1,
      direction: 'clockwise',
      status: 'setup',
      history: []
    });
  }
}

// Pack generation utility (pure function)
function generateDraftPacks(setData: MTGSetData, playerCount: number): Pack[][] {
  const rounds = [];
  
  for (let round = 0; round < 3; round++) {
    const roundPacks = [];
    for (let player = 0; player < playerCount; player++) {
      roundPacks.push(generateBoosterPack(setData));
    }
    rounds.push(roundPacks);
  }
  
  return rounds;
}
```

### Bot Integration & Scheduling

```typescript
// Bots are pure functions that analyze state and return picks
interface DraftBot {
  selectCard(
    availableCards: Card[],
    pickedCards: Card[],
    draftContext: DraftContext,
    personality: BotPersonality
  ): Card;
}

// Bot personality is passed as parameter (no bot state)
type BotPersonality = 'bronze' | 'silver' | 'gold' | 'mythic';

// Engine handles bot scheduling automatically
class DraftEngine {
  // After human pick, process all bot picks for current round
  private processBotTurns(botSelector: DraftBot): ActionResult<DraftEngine> {
    let currentEngine = this;
    
    // Find all bots that need to pick
    const botsNeedingPicks = this.getBotsNeedingPicks();
    
    for (const bot of botsNeedingPicks) {
      const availableCards = currentEngine.getCurrentPack(bot.id);
      if (!availableCards) continue;
      
      const pickedCards = currentEngine.getPlayerCards(bot.id);
      const context = currentEngine.getDraftContext();
      
      // Bot makes decision (pure function)
      const selectedCard = botSelector.selectCard(
        availableCards.cards,
        pickedCards,
        context,
        bot.personality
      );
      
      // Apply bot's pick
      const result = currentEngine.applyAction({
        type: 'MAKE_PICK',
        playerId: bot.id,
        cardId: selectedCard.id
      });
      
      if (!result.success) {
        return result; // Propagate error
      }
      
      currentEngine = result.data;
    }
    
    return { success: true, data: currentEngine };
  }
  
  private getBotsNeedingPicks(): BotPlayer[] {
    return this.state.players
      .filter(p => !p.isHuman && this.getCurrentPack(p.id) !== null)
      .map(p => p as BotPlayer);
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

```typescript
class DraftEngine {
  // Core validation logic
  canMakePick(playerId: string, cardId: string): boolean {
    // 1. Draft must be active
    if (this.state.status !== 'active') return false;
    
    // 2. Player must exist and have a pack
    const player = this.getPlayer(playerId);
    if (!player) return false;
    
    const pack = this.getCurrentPack(playerId);
    if (!pack) return false;
    
    // 3. Card must be in player's current pack
    const cardExists = pack.cards.some(card => card.id === cardId);
    if (!cardExists) return false;
    
    // 4. Must be player's turn (for human players)
    if (player.isHuman && !this.isPlayerTurn(playerId)) return false;
    
    return true;
  }
  
  private isPlayerTurn(playerId: string): boolean {
    // In draft, it's always the human's turn when they have a pack
    // Bots pick automatically after human picks
    const player = this.getPlayer(playerId);
    return player?.isHuman === true && this.getCurrentPack(playerId) !== null;
  }
  
  // Additional validation methods
  private isValidPlayer(playerId: string): boolean {
    return this.state.players.some(p => p.id === playerId);
  }
  
  private isDraftActive(): boolean {
    return this.state.status === 'active';
  }
}
```

### Serialization Strategy

```typescript
// Serialize minimal data - action history + config
interface SerializedDraft {
  config: DraftConfig;
  history: DraftAction[];
  timestamp: number;
}

class DraftEngine {
  serialize(): string {
    return JSON.stringify({
      config: this.state.config,
      history: this.state.history,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
  
  static deserialize(data: string): DraftEngine {
    const saved: SerializedDraft = JSON.parse(data);
    
    // Recreate engine with original config
    let engine = DraftEngine.create(saved.config);
    
    // Replay all actions to restore state
    for (const action of saved.history) {
      const result = engine.applyAction(action);
      if (!result.success) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to replay action: ${result.error.message}`);
      }
      engine = result.data;
    }
    
    return engine;
  }
}

## UI Integration Pattern

### State Bridge

```typescript
// The UI maintains a reference to the engine
interface DraftUIState {
  engine: DraftEngine | null;
  
  // UI-only state (not in engine)
  selectedCard: Card | null;
  hoveredCard: Card | null;
  viewMode: 'draft' | 'deckbuilding';
  
  // Derived state (computed from engine)
  currentPack: Pack | null;
  playerCards: Card[];
  draftProgress: number;
}

// Actions update engine and sync UI with proper error handling
function makePickAction(cardId: string): void {
  if (!uiState.engine) return;
  
  // Apply action to engine
  const result = uiState.engine.applyAction({
    type: 'MAKE_PICK',
    playerId: currentPlayerId,
    cardId
  });
  
  // Handle action result
  if (!result.success) {
    // Show error to user
    showError(result.error.message);
    return;
  }
  
  const newEngine = result.data;
  
  // Update UI state
  setUIState({
    engine: newEngine,
    selectedCard: null
  });
  
  // Persist to storage
  localStorage.setItem(`draft-${newEngine.state.id}`, newEngine.serialize());
  
  // Update URL without refresh
  history.pushState(
    null, 
    '', 
    `/draft/${newEngine.state.id}/p${newEngine.state.currentRound}p${newEngine.state.currentPick}`
  );
}
```

### React Hook Interface

```typescript
// Clean hook API for React components
function useDraftEngine(draftId?: string) {
  const [engine, setEngine] = useState<DraftEngine | null>(null);
  
  // Load engine on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    if (draftId) {
      const saved = localStorage.getItem(`draft-${draftId}`);
      if (saved) {
        setEngine(DraftEngine.deserialize(saved));
      }
    }
  }, [draftId]);
  
  // Action handlers with error handling
  const makePick = useCallback((cardId: string) => {
    if (!engine) return;
    
    const result = engine.applyAction({
      type: 'MAKE_PICK',
      playerId: 'human',
      cardId
    });
    
    if (!result.success) {
      setError(result.error.message);
      return;
    }
    
    setEngine(result.data);
    setError(null);
    
    // Auto-save
    localStorage.setItem(`draft-${result.data.state.id}`, result.data.serialize());
  }, [engine]);
  
  // Derived state
  const currentPack = engine?.getCurrentPack('human') ?? null;
  const playerCards = engine?.getPlayerCards('human') ?? [];
  
  return {
    engine,
    currentPack,
    playerCards,
    makePick,
    // ... other methods
  };
}
```

## Key Benefits

# Development Plan: FlashDraft MTG Draft Simulator

## Overview
Building an integrated Magic: The Gathering draft simulation and playtesting platform that enables unlimited practice with AI opponents trained on real 17lands data. The core workflow is: Draft → (Edit Deck → Playtest) Loop → New Draft

The goal is for someone without any set knowledge to learn to draft by playtesting their deck immediately against real decks.

## Approach
- **MVP-first**: Start with functional draft + basic playtest, then enhance AI
- **Data-driven bots**: Use 17lands datasets for realistic opponent behavior
- **Performance-focused**: <150ms transitions, keyboard shortcuts, snappy interactions
- **Goldfishing-oriented**: Interface is optimized for rapid iteration and goldfishing, to get a good "feel" of the pick process, and a feel for how it affects the deck
  - eg: mana curve distribution
  - creature count
  - card type distribution
- **Low barrier to exploration**: quick back-and-forth between deckbuild and playtest.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Astro + React islands + TypeScript for optimal performance ✓ (Implemented)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind for rapid, consistent interface development ✓ (Implemented with HoverCard component)
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity and snappy state updates ✓ (Implemented complete draft store)
- **Backend**: Astro endpoints https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/ ✓ (API endpoints for sets working)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for card data, pickle for trained models ✓ (Scryfall data cached as JSON)
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn for pairwise ranking models (simple, effective) (Pending 17lands integration)

### Current Technical State
- **Components**: Card, CardImage, CardOverlay, CardTypeIndicators, PackDisplay, DraftInterface, DraftApp
- **Store**: Complete Zustand store with draft state, player management, pack passing, pick tracking
- **API**: Working endpoints at /api/sets and /api/sets/[setCode] serving DTK/FIN data
- **Styling**: Full Tailwind + shadcn/ui integration with proper CSS variables
- **Data**: Two complete MTG sets (DTK: 264 cards, FIN: sets) with images cached from Scryfall
- **Pack Generation**: Realistic rarity distributions (1 rare/mythic, 3 uncommons, 11 commons)
- **Pick Priority**: Basic algorithm (rarity + creature + removal bonuses) - needs 17lands data upgrade

### Key Challenges & Solutions
- **Bot Realism**: Use 17lands real pick data, validate against human baselines
- **Ultra-fast Transitions**: <150ms target requires optimized state management, minimal re-renders
- **Goldfishing UX**: Design for rapid iteration - keyboard shortcuts, visual feedback, instant deck stats
- **Learning Feedback Loop**: Visual cues that connect draft picks to deck performance patterns
- **Card Data**: Source from Scryfall API, cache locally, version appropriately
- **Draft State**: Immutable updates, clear action patterns, robust error handling
- **Deck Analysis**: Real-time mana curve and composition feedback without performance impact

### Dependencies & Risks
- **17lands Data Access**: Public datasets available, but format coverage varies
- **Card Image Rights**: Use Scryfall API with proper attribution
- **ML Training Time**: Initial model training should be <30 minutes on laptop
- **User Adoption**: Target existing Limited community through focused features

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Deep Learning vs. Pairwise Ranking**: Chose pairwise for interpretability and data efficiency
- **Real-time vs. Turn-based**: Chose turn-based for simplicity and focus on learning
- **Full Rules Engine vs. Manual**: Chose manual for faster development and flexibility

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete draft simulation in <5 minutes
