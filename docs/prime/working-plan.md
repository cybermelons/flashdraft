# issues

- for decklist show cards, just the top part with the name and pips. cascade them. 
- don't put that much space between cards for pick layout.
- at bottom of decklist, put sideboard beneath. clicking on decklist puts it in sideboard and vice versa
- put sideboard in engine
- add hover effects like in 17lands or mtga, just the card image

on decklist, a play button link that goes to the testmat.

## testmat

puts deck into a simple test playmat against a random 17lands average deck.
you can click to hide opponents hand.

quick restart against either new deck or same deck.

just modify board to your choosing. as testmat
board doesn't do game mechanics. just has cnounters and markers, tapping, deck.



## quickswitch
quick switch between testmat and game.
