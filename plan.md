1. what's lcg or pcg? probably the lightweight one
2. delta format: i want the same granularity as 17lands. so might as well use their data structures.
3. position caching is what? is it keeping order? it should be an exact replica. a fairly straightforward finite state machine.
4. start from anew for now.
5. the seed should be the draft id. so it's the same.
